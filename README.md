# FeatherPanel Mobile

FeatherPanel Mobile is the official mobile companion app for FeatherPanel, the fast, modern, AI‑powered game server management panel. This repository contains the source code for the client‑focused mobile experience.

> The app is built independently for the FeatherPanel platform and is not an official product of FeatherPanel itself.

## About FeatherPanel

FeatherPanel is a next‑generation game server management panel built for performance, extensibility, and ease of use. It is designed to make hosting and managing game servers as seamless as possible.

## App Ownership and Independence

FeatherPanel Mobile is conceived, developed, and maintained entirely by **CodeForgeX Studio**.  
The app is created to provide a native mobile experience for FeatherPanel users, but it operates as an independent third‑party client.

- **FeatherPanel Mobile** is branded and distributed under the CodeForgeX Studio name.  
- The project is not co‑owned, co‑developed, or jointly managed with FeatherPanel or any associated organizations.  
- All design, development, and store publication decisions are made by CodeForgeX Studio.

## App Focus and Scope

The first releases of FeatherPanel Mobile focus primarily on the **client** experience of the FeatherPanel platform. The goal is to bring as much of the client‑side functionality from the web client area into a native mobile interface as possible.

Planned and existing focus areas include:

- Secure login and account management for FeatherPanel users.  
- Viewing and managing owned game servers from a phone or tablet.  
- Access to key client actions and status information without needing a desktop browser.  
- A responsive, mobile‑first UI that follows the look and feel of FeatherPanel.

## Admin Features

Admin‑oriented functionality will initially remain available through the existing FeatherPanel web interface. Admins should continue to use the web panel for full server and platform management while the mobile app matures.

Over time, more admin capabilities may be introduced into FeatherPanel Mobile, either:

- Incrementally added into the main FeatherPanel Mobile app, or  
- Delivered via a dedicated **Admin** mobile app, depending on what best serves panel administrators.

Until then, FeatherPanel Mobile should be considered a client‑focused companion, with admins relying primarily on the web version for advanced workflows.

## App Names

- Client app: **FeatherPanel Mobile** – the main app for end users interacting with their servers and services.  
- Admin experience: may later share the same app or be released as a separate **FeatherPanel Admin**‑style app, depending on future design and product decisions.

Naming and store listings will clearly indicate which app is intended for clients and which is intended for administrators when admin functionality becomes available.

## Platforms and Distribution

FeatherPanel Mobile is planned for distribution through the major mobile app stores (for example, Android and iOS), with **CodeForgeX Studio** handling development, releases, and publication.

Store links and platform‑specific details will be added here once the app is publicly available.
